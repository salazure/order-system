Program is a pure html, javascript and CSS website. Purpose is to facilitate customers of a certain business in making an inquiry for a catering event.
The program is highly inefficient with too much excess code. As I learn better practices, it will be updated and improved.

There are many files in the repo because I wanted to play around with hosting the website during development.

The code is designed to be manipulated and easily changed on short notice. But at least, that's what I think. Perhaps once I get more experience I'll find it sucks.
